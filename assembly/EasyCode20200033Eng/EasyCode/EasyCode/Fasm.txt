- Remarks
---------------
    If your current version of Easy Code 2 is previous to 2.00.0.0007 (released
    on December 2, 2015), please follow the instructions below.  Otherwise, you
    can disregard the infomation in this document, altogether.


- Directives
---------------
    For  Easy Code to  properly work with  FASM macros and the 'struc' keyword,
    you  should  add  and  modify a  pair of  entries  in your  "Fasm.cfg"  and
    "Fasm64.cfg"  configuration files (as is seen in the equivalent  "Fasm.ori"
    and "Fasm64.ori" files). The entry(ies) should read as follows:

    [Collapse1]
    1=proc $,endp
    2=macro $,}     <-- Modified
    3=struct $,ends
    4=union $,ends
    5=struc $,}     <-- Added

    [MacroBlock]
    1=macro $,}     <-- Modified

    [StructBlock]
    1=struct &,ends
    2=union $,ends
    3=struc $,}     <-- Added

    Without these modifications, Easy Code will not manage FASM macros (nor the
    'struc' keyword) properly.


- High level instructions
--------------------------

    Please open your  "Fasm.cfg" and  "Fasm64.cfg" files and  replace the whole
    line "Group8" with the following one:

    Group8=CARRY?,OVERFLOW?,PARITY?,SIGN?,ZERO?


- Important
---------------
    Note: The information in this section applies ONLY if you are utilizing the
    MASM32 SDK 11 kit downloaded from the MASM32 SDK Project's official website
    at  "http://www.masm32.com/download.htm"  which is based on the Microsoft's
    32-bit  Macro Assembler version 11.  It is imperative  that you  follow all
    supplied  directions to  ensure proper  compilation  of your programs.  If,
    however, you are using  an updated version  of Microsoft's  macro assembler
    and its associated libraries extracted from a different source, such as any
    one of  Microsoft's newer SDK  packages  (version 12 or up),  the following
    information DOES NOT apply to you and should be disregarded.

    1. Easy Code requires the MASM32 SDK in order to build 32-bit projects with
    the  ASMC, JWASM, MASM, POASM and UASM  assemblers. The  MASM32 SDK will be
    necessary for building  32-bit visual/GUI projects with the FASM assembler,
    but FASM classic projects which are  non-visual/non-GUI  do not require the
    MASM32 SDK, at all.  However, the  MASM32 SDK currently available  contains
    some errors in the  'kernel32'  and  'kernel32p'  files which inadvertantly
    cause the  Easy Code linker  (link.exe)  to fail.  To resolve this problem,
    please download the following file at:

    https://easycode.cat/English/Download/kernel.zip

    2. After unzipping the downloaded contents, move the "kernel32.inc" and the
    "kernel32p.inc" files to the  "%root%\masm32\include"  folder, ensuring  to
    overwrite  any existing  copies.  Then, move  the  "kernel32.lib"  and  the
    "kernel32p.lib" files to the "%root%\masm32\lib" folder, again, ensuring to
    overwrite any existing copies.
