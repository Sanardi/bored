This is a complete Easy Code visual project (see below for getting the IDE).

For the EC Player to be able to use the digital font, put the QuartzDB.ttf
file (located at the \EasyCode\Common folder) in the same folder than the
ECPlayer.exe file.

Feel free to improve it and modify it at your own, and please do not forget
to mention my name.


Enjoy with Easy Code!
