The "ECService" example included with Easy Code v2.0 is
owned, programmed and copyrighted by Héctor A. Medina.
Due to the lack of documentation, specially for 64-bit
applications, we decided to include "ECService" as an
example for users to see how to program a service, both
for 32 and 64-bit Windows. No copy or distribution is
allowed without its author permission.
