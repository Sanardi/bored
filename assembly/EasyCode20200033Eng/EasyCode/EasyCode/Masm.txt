    Note: The information in this section applies ONLY if you are utilizing the
    MASM32 SDK 11 kit downloaded from the MASM32 SDK Project's official website
    at:

    "http://www.masm32.com/download.htm"

    which  is based on  Microsoft's  32-bit  Macro Assembler version 11.  It is
    imperative  that  you  follow  all  supplied  directions  to  ensure proper
    compilation of your programs. If, however, you are using an updated version
    of Microsoft's macro  assembler and its associated libraries extracted from
    a  different source,  such as any  one of  Microsoft's  newer  SDK packages
    (version 12 or up),  the following  information  DOES NOT  apply to you and
    should be disregarded.

    1. Easy Code requires the MASM32 SDK in order to build 32-bit projects with
    the ASMC, JWASM, MASM, POASM and UASM  assemblers. The  MASM32 SDK  also is
    necessary for  building 32-bit visual/GUI projects with the FASM assembler,
    but  FASM classic  projects  which are  non-visual/non-GUI  do not  require
    MASM32, at all.  However, the  MASM32 SDK currently available contains some
    errors in the  'kernel32'  and  'kernel32p' files which inadvertantly cause
    the Easy Code  linker (link.exe)  to fail.  To resolve this problem, please
    download the following file:

    https://easycode.cat/English/Download/kernel.zip

    2. After unzipping the downloaded contents, move the "kernel32.inc" and the
    "kernel32p.inc"  files to the  "%root%\masm32\include"  folder, ensuring to
    overwrite  any  existing copies.  Then,  move  the  "kernel32.lib"  and the
    "kernel32p.lib" files to the "%root%\masm32\lib" folder, again, ensuring to
    overwrite any existing copies.
