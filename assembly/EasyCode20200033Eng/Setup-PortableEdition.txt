INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION (32-Bit and 64-Bit Versions) 
=========================================================
Portable Edition

- Description
-------------
Easy Code  is an integrated  rapid application  development system  (RAD) which
utilizes a  visual component-assisted  programming environment for the assembly
language. It features  an enhanced IDE with graphical user interface  (GUI) and
object components.  Easy Code is especially designed for integration with ASMC,
FASM, GOASM, JWASM, MASM32, MASM64, POASM, SOLASM and UASM  assembler libraries
and tools. Version  2.00.0.0012 and later also include the 32-bit and 64-bit of
Easy Code.


- Installation
--------------
1. Please exit from any running instance(s) of Easy Code before continuing with
the installation process.

2. Windows  XP and Later:  Right click on the  "EasyCode.zip"  file and  in the
context menu choose the 'Properties' option.  In the window that will be shown,
click the  "Unblock" button (for Windows 10 check the  "Unblock" check box) and
then click the  "OK"  button so that  all files included in the  "EasyCode.zip"
file can be started normally. All of this is due to a Windows security rule and
has nothing to do with Easy Code.

3. Extract the  "EasyCode.zip" file  to the  desktop and the  "EasyCode" folder
will be created.

4. Move the  "EasyCode" folder  to any of  your hard disks.  However, using the
root system drive  ("C:") is not recommended  but is instead,  strongly advised
against.  This is especially the case in Windows 8 and later due to permissions
restrictions.  If this is not the first time you have installed Easy Code 2 and
the  "EasyCode" folder  already exists, simply  overwrite it. Rest assured that
the data in your  'EasyCode' folder will be  neither deleted nor modified, just
the necessary files in order to update Easy Code v2 to this new version will be
overwritten.

5. If this  is the first time you  download Easy Code 2, close all applications
and open the EasyCode folder. Run the "Settings.exe" program, if possible as an
Administrator. Choose the desired options and then press the "OK" button.
WARNING: On Windows 8.1 and Windows 10  is essential  to run this program as an
Administrator.

6. Run the  "EasyCode.exe or EasyCode64.exe" programs (which are located in the
"EasyCode\Bin" folder) or use the icons on the desktop if you created them with
the "Settings" program.

7. Attention:  If you are running  Easy Code for the first time  YOU MUST GO to
the  'Tools-->Settings' menu item, select the 'Configurations' tab, and set the
paths for all  configuration files or,  at least,  for those you  wish to  work
with, such as GoAsm or Masm. The configuration files (*.cfg) are located in the
'Config' folder (see the "Remarks" section below) and they are distributed with
default values as a guide for you to know what to configure. However, they need
to be modified  according to the paths where your tools are located. Now please
carefully read the  "Settings" topic of the Easy Code help file, located in the
"EasyCode\Help" folder.

8. Maintenance: Since Easy Code NEVER writes your "*.cfg" files in order not to
modify your configurations, it is recommended to check  the "*.ori"  files when
downloading a new version.  If they have changed from the previous version, you
should copy the modifications  (usually new opcodes) from each  "*.ori" file to
its corresponding "*.cfg" one.  However, last versions of  Easy Code already do
most of those changes automatically.


- Remarks
---------
1. The configuration files are placed in the  "EasyCode\Config"  folder and are
distributed with the "*.ori" (original) extension.  However, they must have the
"*.cfg"  extension in order to work.  When Easy Code  starts, it checks whether
each "*.ori" file has its "*.cfg" equivalent file.  If the "*.cfg" file already
exists nothing happens,  if not,  it makes a copy of the  "*.ori" file but with
the "*.cfg" extension. Doing so makes sure that the "*.cfg" files will never be
overwritten  as they are  the valid files  where  all  configurations are saved
depending on the available tools while, at the same time, the "*.ori" files are
always available  as a reference for the  "Settings" process.  Easy Code always
takes care of making all necessary copies from "*.ori" to "*.cfg" extension, so
you do not have to worry about that (please see the step 8. Maintenance).

2. Please see the  Easy Code help file  in order to know what tools you need to
install - such as MASM32 SDK, or the 'Go Tools',  as well as the GoASM Headers.

3. If you want to have the help file in  Czech language, please download it at:

- Conclusion
------------
Easy Code is now ready to be used.  You can run  it by  double-clicking  on the
desktop shortcut  if you chose to  create one (see the  'Installation' section,
item 6). At this time, the "Settings.exe" file is no longer needed. So, you may
delete it if you like and without significant consequence. However, doing so is
not very advisable  in such  case where  its settings  have become corrupted or
over-written by a different programming application.
